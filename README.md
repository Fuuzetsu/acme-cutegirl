As some people don't seem to get the joke and even think that this
package is making fun of some person I know, here's a README.

This is a joke package based on an old exploitable from 2chan. You can
read about it
[here](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/glasses-sayaka-too-bad-it-was-just-me).

I hope that's out of the way. Personally I think it's only funny if
you're in on the joke to begin with but whatever.
